Assignment 6: (still working on questions)

1. The snippet of code will not function correctly because the struct is in main(). 
2. Structures are collections of related variables under a single name. Enumerates define a set of named integer canstants starting from 0. 
3. Passing an array directly to a function as an argument. Passing a structure containing an array causes the array to be copied to the function's parameter.
